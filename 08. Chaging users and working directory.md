## WORKDIR - Changing the working direcory
#### Starting all paths at the root of the file system:
COPY /projects/pipeline_v3/ /app/

#### Becomes cluttered when working with long paths:
COPY /projects/pipeline_v3/ /home/my_user_with_a_long_name/work/projects/app/

#### Alternatively, use WORKDIR:
WORKDIR /home/my_user_with_a_long_name/work/projects/
COPY /projects/pipeline_v3/ app/

## Changing the user in an image
### Best practice: Don't run everything as root
Ubuntu -> root by default
FROM ubuntu         --> Root user by default
RUN apt-get update  --> Run as root
### USER Dockerfile instruction:
FROM ubuntu         --> Root user by default
USER repl           --> Changes the user to repl
RUN apt-get update  --> Run as repl

## Changing the user in a container
### Dockerfile setting the user to repl:
FROM ubuntu         --> Root user by default
USER repl           --> Changes the user to repl
RUN apt-get update  --> Run as repl
